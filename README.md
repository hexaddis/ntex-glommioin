Actix web is a small, fast, down-to-earth, open source rust web framework.

```rust,ignore
use actix_web::*;

fn index(req: HttpRequest) -> String {
    format!("Hello {}!", &req.match_info()["name"])
}

fn main() {
    HttpServer::new(
        || Application::new()
            .resource("/{name}", |r| r.f(index)))
        .serve::<_, ()>("127.0.0.1:8080");
}
```

## Benchmarks

This is totally unscientific and probably pretty useless. In real world business
logic would dominate on performance side. But in any case. i took several web frameworks
for rust and used theirs *hello world* example. All projects are compiled with
`--release` parameter. I didnt test single thread performance for iron and rocket.
As a testing tool i used `wrk` and following commands

`wrk -t20 -c100 -d10s http://127.0.0.1:8080/`

`wrk -t20 -c100 -d10s http://127.0.0.1:8080/ -s ./pipeline.lua --latency -- / 128`

I ran all tests on localhost on MacBook Pro late 2017. It has 4 cpu and 8 logical cpus.
Each result is best of five runs. All measurements are req/sec.

Name | 1 thread | 1 pipeline | 3 thread | 3 pipeline | 8 thread | 8 pipeline
---- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------
Actix | 89.100 | 815.200 | 122.100 | 1.877.000 | 107.400 | 2.350.000
Gotham | 61.000 | 178.000 |   |   |   |
Iron |   |   |   |   | 94.500 | 78.000
Rocket |   |   |   |   | 95.500 | failed
Shio | 71.800 | 317.800 |   |   |   |   |
tokio-minihttp | 106.900 | 1.047.000 |   |   |   |

Some notes on results. Iron and Rocket got tested with 8 threads,
which showed best results. Gothan and tokio-minihttp seem does not support
multithreading, or at least i couldn't figured out. I manually enabled pipelining
for *Shio* and Gotham*. While shio seems support multithreading, but it showed
absolutly same results for any how number of threads (maybe macos problem?)
Rocket completely failed in pipelined tests.
